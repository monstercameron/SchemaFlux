# Classify Example - Sentiment Analysis

## What This Does

Demonstrates the **Classify** operation: categorizing text into predefined categories.

This example classifies:
- **Input**: Customer review text
- **Categories**: positive, negative, neutral
- **Output**: Sentiment classification for each review

## Use Case

**Real-World Applications**:
- Customer feedback analysis
- Social media monitoring
- Email categorization (spam/not spam)
- Content moderation
- Support ticket classification

## How It Works

```go
sentiment, err := ops.Classify(
    review.Text,
    ops.NewClassifyOptions().WithCategories([]string{"positive", "negative", "neutral"}),
)
```

The LLM intelligently:
1. Analyzes text tone and language
2. Identifies emotional indicators
3. Considers context and nuance
4. Assigns to most appropriate category
5. Handles edge cases and sarcasm

## Running the Example

# Set your API key
