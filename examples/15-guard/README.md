# Guard Example - Order State Validation

## What This Does

Demonstrates the **Guard** operation: validating state and conditions before proceeding with an action.

This example validates:
- **Input**: E-commerce orders ready for shipping
- **Checks**: 5 guard conditions (payment, address, items, status, total)
- **Output**: Pass/fail with detailed check results

## Use Case

**Real-World Applications**:
- Pre-condition validation (before actions)
- State machine transitions
- Workflow gate checks
- Safety validations
- Business rule enforcement
- Access control verification

## How It Works

```go
result := ops.Guard(order, checks...)

if result.Passed {
    // Safe to proceed with shipping
    shipOrder(order)
} else {
    // Show which checks failed
    for _, check := range result.Checks {
        if !check.Passed {
            log.Printf("Failed: %s", check.Message)
        }
    }
}
```

The guard system:
1. Runs all validation checks
2. Collects results and messages
3. Fails fast on first failure (optional)
4. Returns detailed pass/fail status
5. Provides actionable feedback

## Running the Example

```bash
# Set your API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-key-here'

# Run the example
go run main.go
```

## Expected Output

## Guard Patterns

Common guard check patterns:
1. **Pre-conditions**: Verify state before action

3. **Data Validation**: Ensure data integrity
4. **Resource Availability**: Check limits/quotas
5. **Business Rules**: Enforce policies
6. **Safety Checks**: Prevent dangerous operations
